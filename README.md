> [!NOTE]  
> This repository was created in December 2024, and the questions provided here are based on the JavaScript syntax and behavior as of now. Since JavaScript is a constantly evolving language, future updates to the language may introduce features that are not covered in the questions here.

###### 1. What's the output?

```javascript
function sayHi() {
  console.log(name);
  console.log(age);
  var name = "Rajnish";
  let age = 25;
}

sayHi();
```

- A: `Rajnish` and `undefined`
- B: `Rajnish` and `ReferenceError`
- C: `ReferenceError` and `21`
- D: `undefined` and `ReferenceError`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

Within the function, we first declare the `name` variable with the `var` keyword. This means that the variable gets hoisted (memory space is set up during the creation phase) with the default value of `undefined`, until we actually get to the line where we define the variable. We haven't defined the variable yet on the line where we try to log the `name` variable, so it still holds the value of `undefined`.

Variables with the `let` keyword (and `const`) are hoisted, but unlike `var`, don't get <i>initialized</i>. They are not accessible before the line we declare (initialize) them. This is called the "temporal dead zone". When we try to access the variables before they are declared, JavaScript throws a `ReferenceError`.

###### 2. What's the output?

```javascript
(function (x) {
  return (function (y) {
    console.log(x);
  })(2);
})(1);
```

- A: `1` and `2`
- B: `2` and `1`
- C: `1`
- D: `2`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: C

Because of closure.

###### 3. What's the output?

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(i);
  }, i * 1000);
}
```

- A: `0 1 2 3 4`
- B: `5 5 5 5 5`
- C: `Undefined Undefined Undefined Undefined Undefined`
- D: `Error`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

The output is 0 1 2 3 4, as described in Option A, because let is block-scoped.

###### 4. What's the output?

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(i);
  }, i * 1000);
}
```

- A: `0 1 2 3 4`
- B: `Error`
- C: `Undefined Undefined Undefined Undefined Undefined`
- D: `5 5 5 5 5`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: D

`var` is function-scoped:
When using `var`, the variable `i` is not block-scoped but function-scoped. This means that all iterations of the for loop share the same `i` variable.

How `setTimeout` works:
The function inside `setTimeout` is a callback that executes after the specified delay. By the time these callbacks execute (after `i * 1000` milliseconds), the `for` loop has already completed its execution, and the value of `i` has become `5`.

What happens in the loop:

The loop runs 5 times, incrementing `i` from `0` to `4`.
Each time, `setTimeout` schedules a callback to run after i \_ 1000 milliseconds.
However, all these callbacks reference the same i variable.
By the time the first callback executes (after `0 * 1000` ms), the `for` loop has completed, and `i` is now `5`.

###### 5. What's the output?

```javascript
functionName();

function functionName() {
  console.log("Functions are hoisted");
}
console.log(x);

var x = 5;
```

- A: `Functions are hoisted` `undefined`
- B: `Functions are hoisted` `5`
- C: `ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization`
- D: `TypeError: functionName is not a function`

<details><summary><b>Answer</b></summary>
<p>

#### Answer: A

Function Hoisting:

The function `functionName` is hoisted, meaning it is available throughout the entire scope.
Calling `functionName()` before its declaration works fine, and the output is `Functions are hoisted`.

Variable Hoisting:

The variable `x` is declared using `var`, which is hoisted to the top of its scope but initialized with `undefined` until the line where it is assigned a value (`x = 5`).
Therefore, when `console.log(x)` is executed, it outputs `undefined`.
